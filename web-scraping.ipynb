    "   - **Opening Developer Tools:** Right-click anywhere on the Wikipedia page and select \"Inspect\" or \"Inspect Element\" (the option might vary slightly depending on your browser). This will open the developer tools window.\n",

    "   - **Locating the Headlines:** Navigate to the section of the webpage where the title headlines reside. Use the developer tools to pinpoint these elements. You can hover over elements on the page to see their corresponding HTML code in the developer tools window.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Identifying the Class:** Look for the class attribute within the HTML code for the title headline elements. This attribute will likely be named something like `\"class\"` and will have a value representing the class name (e.g., `\"mw-headline\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Refining the Code (Optional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Once you've identified the correct class name, replace `\"mw-headline\"` in the following code snippet with the actual class name you discovered on the Wikipedia page:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `find_all` method is a versatile way to locate all elements matching a specific tag. Here, it finds all occurrences of the `<link>` tag.\n",
    "   - The `for` loop iterates through each element (`link`) in the list returned by `find_all`.\n",
    "   - Inside the loop, printing `link` will display the complete HTML code for each `<link>` element found on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding the Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- By running this loop, you'll see the complete HTML code for each `<link>` element, including its attributes like the `href` attribute, which might contain the URL of the linked resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",

    "1. **Finding Image Elements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The code begins by using `data_page_soup.findAll('img')`. This line utilizes BeautifulSoup's `findAll` method (similar to `find_all`) to locate all elements on the webpage that match the `<img>` tag. The `<img>` tag is used to represent images on webpages.\n",

    "\n",
    "   - We create an empty list named `images_urls` to store the extracted image URLs.\n",

    "   - The code then iterates through the list of image elements (`images`) using a `for` loop.\n",

    "   - The `urljoin` function from `urllib.parse` comes into play here. It takes two arguments: the base URL (the URL of the webpage we scraped) and the relative URL extracted from the `'src'` attribute. The `urljoin` function intelligently combines these parts to form the complete image URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The combined image URL is then appended to the `images_urls` list using the `append` method. This process continues for each image element in the loop, building a list containing all the extracted image URLs."
