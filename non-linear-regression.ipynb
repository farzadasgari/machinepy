    "## Limitations of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "While linear regression is a powerful tool for modeling relationships between variables, it has its limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumes Linearity:** The primary limitation is its assumption of a linear relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variables (x). This means it can only capture straight-line patterns. If the data exhibits non-linear trends, such as curves, bends, or exponential growth, linear regression will not accurately capture the underlying relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Flexibility:** Due to its linear nature, linear regression cannot model complex relationships that deviate from straight lines. This can lead to inaccurate predictions and misleading interpretations in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider the equation you mentioned: $y = 3x + 1$. This represents a perfect straight line with a constant slope of 3. However, many real-world phenomena don't follow such simple linear patterns. For instance, modeling population growth or economic trends often requires more complex models that can capture non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while linear regression offers a valuable tool for specific situations, it's important to be aware of its limitations and consider alternative approaches like non-linear regression when dealing with data that exhibits non-linear patterns.\n"

    "    - `curve_fit(sigmoid, xdata, ydata)`: This function attempts to fit the defined Sigmoid function (`sigmoid`) to the normalized data (`xdata` and `ydata`).\n",
    "    - It uses an optimization algorithm to find the best values for the parameters (`a` and `b`) of the Sigmoid function that minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values.\n",

    "    - `popt`: This variable stores the optimized parameter values (`a` and `b`) found by the optimization process.\n",
    "    - `pcov`: This variable contains the covariance matrix, which provides information about the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates.\n",
    "- **Printing Optimized Parameters:**\n",

    "    - `plt.plot(xdata, ydata, 'ro', label='data')`: This line plots the original data points (`xdata`, `ydata`) as red circles with the label \"data\".\n",
    "    - `plt.plot(x_reg, y_reg, linewidth=2, label='fit')`: This line plots the predicted y-values (`y_reg`) for the generated `x_reg` values as a blue line with a thicker line width (2) and the label \"fit\".\n",
    "    - `plt.legend(loc='best')`: This line adds a legend to the plot for clarity.\n",
    "    - `plt.ylabel('GDP')` and `plt.xlabel('Year')`: These lines set the labels for the y-axis and x-axis, respectively.\n",
    "    - `plt.show()`: This line displays the generated plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot allows us to visually compare the actual GDP data with the predicted values based on the fitted Sigmoid function. We can assess how well the Sigmoid function captures the overall trend and any potential deviations from the actual data.\n"

    "As we have normalized the data for fitting the Sigmoid function, it's crucial to evaluate the model's performance on the original, non-normalized data. \n",
